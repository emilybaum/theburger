# The Ultimate Burger List
The Ultimate Burger List! is an interactive app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat -- or rather just the best burgers ever. 

## How it works
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten. Each burger in the waiting area also has a **Eat it now!** button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every burger in a database, whether eaten or not. You also have the ability to **Remove** a burger at any time too.
